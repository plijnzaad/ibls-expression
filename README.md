# ibls-expression
This repository contains exercises/code for the UBC Master's course Introduction to Bioinformatics for the Life Sciences
(you can find it at https://elearning.ubc.uu.nl/course/view.php?id=9# if you have access).

Data for the  exercises comes from a study by Liu et al., who created Smchd1 knock-out mice and studied the changes in RNA expression in neural stem cells. Smchd1 is an epigenetic repressor that plays a role in, amongst others, X-inactivation. 

(Liu et al., Genomics Data 7 (2016) 144â€“147. /Transcriptional profiling of the epigenetic regulator Smchd1/ )

The exercises are inside the comments in the R files. Don't blindly copy-paste things; try to really understand what is going on, e.g. by playing around with the arguments and by looking up the documentation of the functions.

The files are, in chronological order (the lecture it goes with is given in parentheses)

 * exploring-expression-data.R  (/Measuring Expression/ )
 * statistics.R   ( /Statistics/ )
 * gene-selections.R ( /Gene Ontology and Functional Enrichment/ )
 * glimma.R  ( /no lecture; more like an encore/ )

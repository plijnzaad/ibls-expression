# ibls-expression

This repository contains exercises/code for the UBC Master's course
Introduction to Bioinformatics for the Life Sciences. You can find the
lectures, the data and some reference material at
https://elearning.ubc.uu.nl/course/view.php?id=9# (access is not
public).

Data for the exercises comes from a study by Liu et al., who created
Smchd1 knock-out mice and studied the changes in RNA expression in
neural stem cells. Smchd1 is an epigenetic repressor that plays a role
in, amongst others, X-inactivation.

(Liu et al., Genomics Data 7 (2016) 144â€“147. *Transcriptional profiling of the epigenetic regulator Smchd1* )

All exercises can be found in `transcriptomics.ipynb`.

There are three parts in it, one going with each of the separate
lectures. (They are all in the same file, because they build on each
other and therefore all have to be in the same session).

# Important

Don't blindly copy-paste things: try to really understand what is going
on, e.g. by playing around with function arguments and by looking up the
documentation of the functions.
